Mention in Observer Pattern section:
    -- several ways to implement (events, delegates, polymorphism)
    -- clarify differences
    -- delegates usage in this project

Don't forget about this thought (I was indeed right):
"If there hadn't been any change in state, would it still be State pattern? I assume, not -- it would've
been just usage of polymorphism. I also assume that it could be called Strategy pattern."
