# design-patterns

## Project Structure
The project serves as a sample to demo the use of several design patterns. The primary idea of the project is to emulate the work of a compiler which produces a syntax tree (AST) from some logical expression (e.g. `a and b or c`). At this moment compilation consists of 3 steps:
  1. Preprocessing (macros substitution);
  2. Lexical analysis (tokens generation);
  3. Parsing (AST creation).
